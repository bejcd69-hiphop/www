    <h2>Legacies</h2>
    <p><strong>DJ Ido (MC Fresh Mix):</strong> DJ Ido is an early Hip Hop figure from Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is known for his contributions to the local Hip Hop scene during the 1980s and for preserving the culture's legacy through personal commentary and historical documentation.<br><br>
    DJ Ido is frequently mentioned alongside other early pioneers of Bihać's Hip Hop movement including DJ Vuki, Beytz D, "Mali" Rade, Deyan, Meshan and Maska. His reflections appear in historical notes tied to the track <em>"Bihac Hip Hop Anthem of The 80s"</em> on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bihachiphop" target="_blank">SoundCloud</a> :<br><br>
       <div class="comment">
          “Regardless [of the] war in Bosnia the true HIP HOP Spirit has survived in Bihać. The young, true HIP HOP warriors have picked up it where the Screw Boys had to stop.” — DJ Ido<br><br>
       </div>  
       DJ Ido provides key insights into the evolution of groups such as "Electroshock Crew" which later became known as "Screw Boys". These crews performed in various local venues between 1982 and 1989 contributing to the growth of the B-Boying, DJing, MCing and Aerosol/Graffiti subcultures within the city.
    </p>
    <p><strong>DJ Vuki:</strong> A pioneering Hip Hop DJ and one of the first Aerosol artists from Bihać. He co-founded Electroshock Crew with MC Fresh Mix, Mister B and MCA, later evolving into Screw Boys after Beytz D joined. Remembered as the main DJ at the historic 1989 Club Azra event, his contributions paved the way for later generations of DJs, MCs and graffiti artists in the region.</p>
